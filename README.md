# octafilt3r

|||
|-|-|
|`octafilt3r` is a python module for continuous signal filtering with fractional octave filters. It is able to generate non-FFT-based spectrograms, which can be used for machine learning. Despite their low resolution, the spectrograms capture the most important characteristics of a sound. This makes them suitable for applications with low data troughput |<img src="GRAPHICS/octafilt3r_logo.png" alt="logo" width="300"/>|
